        My initial brief design was  a 3d interactive map that displays categorical data about particular languages and cultures. The purpose of this is to improve people’s memory of geographical knowledge. The idea of traveling overseas can be daunting when you’ve forgotten tacit information about the world.My idea originated from the remerging of globalized interactions, amidst the loosening of pandemic restrictions. Something that inspired this project was a blog I found that visualizes global data. This is called ‘our world in data’ which displays very unique statistical art pieces that are yet so informative of the world. https://ourworldindata.org/blog
<br/><br/>
        For this project I wanted to create a futuristic aesthetic yet something that looked like it came from the early stages of the internet. Because of this, p5js was a perfect avenue for creating the look and feel of my design. I came up with ideas for a 3d globe to have data visualization rotating around it. 
<br/><br/>       
        Throughout the project, my brief changed over the course of creating the prototype, particularly in terms of  the type of data. Instead of providing interesting facts, I decided to use more comparable data that could be summarized as a ‘top country’ in a certain statistic. This was because it created a more simple diagram to understand as something that is rotating slowly around the screen is hard to understand as a collective body of information and more of an animation. 
<br/><br/> 
        For the data aspect of my project, I used 3 main sources. These were 5 highest GDP countries, 5 highest energy consumers, and lastly highest positive mental health. This was decided as it was a very random selection of data. However, this was intentional to show the potential of viewing data in this form. This is because I have broad ideas for the concept as this prototype could show endless amounts of data if there was the backend necessary to provide this, (in my case I was running the data within the source code). 
<br/><br/>
The prototype works by changing the globe image depending on what data option is selected, with the specific countries of interest highlighted. One thing I would’ve liked to have perfected for the interaction of the globes rotation is the consistency between the X and Y buttons, since using different ones resets the position of the globe. Initially, the globe was rotated by the mouse position, however this was not as smooth as expected either. In the future I will come back to this project and possibly pitch it to investors. 
<br/><br/>
For each country there is a color ordered key, hottest to coldest. To create the colors I used the adobe color palette selector <a href='https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel'>https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel</a>.
